# -AI-GENERATED-Goatlings-Shop-HTM-to-CSV
This is a simple script where you give it a htm file of your goatlings shop, and it outputs a csv file which you can use to do spreadsheet things with (sort by price, name, description, value, etc.) I did NOT write this code! I had the Google AI Gemini write it for me. Please check the top of the readme file for safety practices and how to use.
